# parse_text_to_csv

In this version, the parse_text_to_csv function returns the parsed data so that it can be used in another function, extract_column. The extract_column function takes in the data and column_index as arguments, and uses a list comprehension to extract the specific column data and return it as a list. In the example, the first column is extracted and printed, but you can change the column_index argument to extract any other column.
